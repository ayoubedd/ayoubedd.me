## Education

I attended 1337 Coding school, where I gained valuable knowledge and skills in software
development. The curriculum focused on practical coding exercises and projects, allowing me to gain
hands-on experience in various programming languages and technologies. Through rigorous training and
collaboration with peers, I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking,
and software engineering principles. This experience has greatly contributed to my growth as a
developer and prepared me for real-world challenges in the industry.

## Experiencel

I have experience
working as a software developer intern at a tech company, where I developed and maintained software
systems, troubleshooted technical issues, and collaborated with a team of professionals. This
opportunity allowed me to apply my coding skills in a professional setting, gain exposure to
industry best practices, and learn from experienced developers. I also had the chance to work on
real-world projects, contribute to team meetings, and participate in code reviews, enhancing my
understanding of software development processes and teamwork.
